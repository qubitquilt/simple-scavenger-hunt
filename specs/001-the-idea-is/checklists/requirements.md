# Spec Quality Checklist for Scavenger Hunt App

**Date:** 2025-10-10

**Spec Link:** [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Validation Items

- [x] All key user scenarios from description are covered in prioritized stories (P1 for core user flow, P2 for admin functions)
- [x] Functional requirements are unambiguous and testable (each FR uses Given-When-Then style where applicable, covers all described features)
- [x] Key entities are defined if data is involved (User, ScavengerHuntEvent, Question, Answer, Progress outlined with attributes and relationships)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable and tech-agnostic (e.g., time-based completion rates, concurrency handling, admin task times)
- [x] Edge cases are identified (e.g., invalid submissions, partial progress, duplicate names, borderline AI scores)
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items remaining (all 3 resolved: borderline AI resolution via unlimited retries until threshold, prize claiming via on-screen instructions, admin access as single role)
- [x] Assumptions are documented (e.g., app access method, data retention, AI criteria, admin auth basics)
- [x] Structure follows template (preserves section order: User Scenarios, Requirements with subsections, Success Criteria; removed irrelevant optionals like non-mandatory sections)

## Notes

- All clarifications resolved based on user input; spec is finalized.
- Validation complete: all items pass.
- Spec focuses on WHAT/WHY, avoids HOW (no tech details like databases, AI implementation).
